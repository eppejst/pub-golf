<!-- #### Last year’s event was not ideal for Collin. An aggressive play on the 6th hole (Union) left him reeling for the rest of the tournament. At the post-halfway hole, he attempted to stay in contention with a Long Island chug followed by 3 gummy bear shots. At the next bar, the consequences set in and he had to withdraw from the tournament. Let’s hope this year he learns to lay up. -->

> **Weakness:** Leker

<!-- #### Jason is a versatile drinker, no strong weakness in any type of alcohol. Though he can use any club in his bag, he’ll have a strong advantage for the Wine on High hole, where his knowledge and passion for the fermented grape juice will leave competitors in the dust. Jason also brings spirited energy and optimism to the tournament. The other golfers will be sure to appreciate his antics. -->

> **Strength:** Sætte grænser\
> **Weakness:** Hunder

<!-- #### Matt left early last year to attend a Jackets game (they probably didn’t win). For the portion of holes he attended, his knowledge of golf and sports came in clutch, including a win at Mike’s Grill Trivia. Matt is still a college student, so his drinking skills are not to be overlooked. Analysts are dubbing him a dark horse to finish strong this year, as long as he doesn’t have tickets to anything. -->
